I have read and understood the Academic Misconduct section in the course outline. I assert this work is my own.

**1a)**

- For any image $f$, we need to find two total functions $s \land t \in 0..L-1 \to 0..L-1\mid f = s \; o \; f \land f = t \; o \; g$ <br>
- To do this, we will use the identity function $i$. The identity function is a total function where it returns the value that was used as its argument without being changed. (ex. $f(x) = x$)
- Let's say $s = t = i$ where $s(x) = x \land t(x) = x, \; \forall x \in 0..L-1$
- From this, we have \
  $(f = s \; o \; f = i \; o \; f = f) \land \\(f=t\; o \; f =i\; o \; f =f)$
- $\therefore$ we have shown $f\;R\;f$ meaning it is reflexive

**1b)**

- For any image $f \land g$, we need to find two total functions $s \land t \in 0..L-1 \to 0..L-1 \mid g = s \; o \; f \land f = t \; o \; g$, then $\exists$ two total functions $u \land v \in 0..L-1 \to 0..L-1 \mid f = u \; o \; g \land g = v \; o \; f$
- Now let's define $u = t \land v = s$, then we have \
  $f = u\; o \; g = t \; o \; g$ $\land$ \
  $g = v\; o \; f = s \; o \; f$
- $\therefore$ We have shown $f\;R\;g$ then $g\;R\;f$ meaning it is symmetric

**1c)**

- Let's assume that $f R g \land g R h$. $\exists$ total functions $s \land t \in 0..L-1 \to 0..L-1 \mid g = s \; o \; f \land f = t \; o \; g$
- Let's also assume that $\exists$ total functions $u \land v \in 0..L-1 \to 0..L-1 \mid g = u \; o \; h \land h = v \; o \; g$
- Then we want to show that that $\exists$ two total functions $m \land n \mid f = m \; o \; h \land h = n \; o \; f$
- To do this let's define $m \land n$ as the following: \
  $m = u \; o \; s$ \
  $n = t \; o \; v$
- We can compose these two functions and use the associative property to show that \
  $f = m \; o \; h = (u \; o \; s) \; o \; h = u \; o \; (s \; o \; h) \land \\ 
  h = n \; o \; f = (t \; o \; v) \; o \; f = t \; o \; (v \; o \; f)$
- $\therefore$ we have shown $f\;R\;g \land g\;R\;h,$ then $f\;R\;h$

**2.** There are $3^6 = 729$ total images since for each value of $M \times N$, we have 3 possible values of $L$ to choose from $\therefore L^{MN}$
