### Compiling and Running

-   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine then in the root directory, run:
-   ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
-   For MacOS, pip3 should work, otherwise use pip
-   This will install necessary libraries like Tkinter for the UI, Pillow to load images, numpy to perform array operations, and matplotlib to draw figures
-   Then simply run the GUI file by doing:
-   ```
    python3 gui.py
    ```
-   For MacOS, python3 should work, otherwise use python
