# WORST MIDTERM AVG Q's

-   Let $H_n$ be the normalized hist of $f$. Contrast is statistically optimal if for any gray level $u$ we have $H_n(u)$ = **?**
    -   [x] $H_n(u) = 1/256$
-   A gray level mapping m is applied to 8-bit, the output images are always completely black (the only gray level is 0), completely white(the only gray level is 255), or black and white (the gray levels are 0 and 255), select all that apply.
    -   We can be certain that m is NOT a linear mapping
    -   We can be certain that m is NOT a piece-wise linear mapping
    -   [x] We can be certain that m is NOT a log mapping
    -   We can be certain that m is NOT a power law mapping
-   Consider five pixel locations $p1, p2, p3, p4, p5$ in an image and five pixel locations $q1, q2, q3, q4, q5$ in another image. We are looking for a function $T$ such that $T(p1) = q1, T(p2) = q2, T(p3) = q3, T(p4) = q4, T(p5) = q5$. Which one of the following best describes this problem?
    -   Single pixel operation
    -   Neighborhood operation
    -   Geometric spatial transformation
    -   Image transform
    -   binary single pixel operation
    -   [x] Image registration
    -   Multispectral transformation
-   An $M \times N$ image $f$ is resized into a $P \times Q$ image $g$. The associated spatial transformation is a function $T$ from $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ that maps $(x,y)$ to $(u,v)$ where $u$ = **?**
    -   [x] $u = x(P-1) / (M-1)$
-   Consider the total functions from $\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}$ defined below. Which one/s is/are NOT distances on $\mathbb{Z}^2$?
    -   [x] $f((x,y), (x', y')) = min(|x-x'|, |y-y'|)$
    -   $f((x,y), (x', y')) = (|x-x'|, |y-y'|) / 2$
    -   $f((x,y), (x', y')) = max(|x-x'|, |y-y'|)$
-   Consider the convolution kernel $h$ and the image $f$ below. $(2,2)$ is the location at the centre of the image $f$. we have $(h*f)(2,2) =$ **?**
    -   [[1 2 3], [4 5 6], [7 8 9]] $*$ [[5 7 1 0 4], [0 1 1 0 2], [4 0 3 1 4]] contd... (didn't have enough time to type entire kernel)
    -   [x] = **68**
-   The term "negation of an 8-bit grayscale image" actually refers to a fuzzy negation. There is an infinite number of fuzzy negations. For example a Sugeno negation is a fuzzy negation that maps an element of $t$ of [0, 1] to **?**, where $p$ is a real number greater than -1
    -   [x] **$(1-t) / \{ 1 + pt \}$**
    -   [x] **$(1-t)/ \{ 1+tp \}$**
    -   [x] **$(1-t)/ \{ pt+1 \}$**
    -   [x] **$(1-t)/ \{ tp+1 \}$**
